# Introduction

> Are you cursed with knowledge in general?... well then consider becoming a Quiz Wizard!

![](https://github.com/pbiswas101/Quizard/blob/master/public/assets/logo.png)

A [React][1] based application implemented using the [JAMstack][2] principles where one passing the quiz shall win the title of **Quizard**!

###### Project Idea

An online quiz app where questions would be asked on topics selected by the user. This is a timer-based quiz with four options for every question with only one being correct. Now, after successfully completing the quiz, the user will be mailed with a digital badge and the score reflecting his/her performance!

## <a href="#1">Tools</a>

Since this is a JAMstack application there won't be any server-side programming involved. Most of the backend work are going to be abstracted away with:
- [Formspree][3] - for sending mails
- [Netlify][4] - for hosting the site

Now, frontend (as mentioned above) is to implemented with:
- [React][1] - library for building UI
- [Materialize.css][5] - library for designing UI

## <a href="#2">Color Pallete</a>

The color palette are inspired from the logo itself and the entire application must reflect these set of colors:

- <strong>#555273</strong>
- <strong>#78758f</strong>
- <strong>#a4b0c3</strong>
- <strong>#8594af</strong>
- <strong>#65799b</strong>
- <strong>#83859e</strong>
- <strong>#ffffff</strong>
- <strong>#000000</strong>

## <a href="#3">Installation</a>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

This will install all the relevant packages required for the project!

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

**NOTE: Don't use it since we'll only be developing the project! Netlify will automatically build it for us.**

### `npm run eject`

**NOTE: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back! So, never use this one!**
